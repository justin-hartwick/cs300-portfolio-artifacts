# CS 300 Portfolio Artifact Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
The main problem was building a system to help advisors manage and retrieve course information efficiently, including sorting and displaying courses in alphanumeric order.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I explored and evaluated different data structures—vector, hash table, and binary search tree—to determine the most effective option based on runtime and memory. Then I implemented the chosen structure in a working program.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I had issues with understanding traversal logic and debugging input errors. Careful step-through, reading documentation, and revisiting course notes helped resolve them.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
I’ve become more methodical about choosing data structures and evaluating scalability in software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I’m more focused now on modular design, clear naming, and documentation so future edits are easier and more understandable.
